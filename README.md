# GRAMS-AI_array_basic
Array BASIC programs for GRAMS/AI  
This is a collection of Array BASIC programs that I have written over many years.  They all solve a very specific problem with time-based data in my lab.  A lot of them are focused on converting data from OceanOptics .TimeSeries data and from PicoScope oscilloscope traces.  
## What is Array BASIC  
Array BASIC is a version of BASIC placed in the SpectraCalc, LabCalc, and GRAMS software packages when Galactic Industries first developed them.  It is has a very limited scope of functions but uses GOTO, so use it for the lolz.
